Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, treat each file separately?

It is because git is made for version control of programs and 
program files are generally interrelated so in a single commit 
all of the changes can be saved.

history of files?

git log can be used to see the changelog, along with -- stat

versions, deleted lines are prefixed with -- and are shown in 
green colour while lines added are prefixed with ++ and are 
shown in red colour.

How might using version control make you more confident to make 
changes that could break something?

working version allowing one to make changes easily and with 
more confidence.
