How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	viewing the difference between two versions helps spot the
	bug easily as only the lines that have been changed are 
	shown making it easy to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Easy acces to the history ensures that one can go back and
	look anything making it easier to learn from previous
	mistakes. One can also go back to previous version if he
	does something wrong.
