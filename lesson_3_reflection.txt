When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    remote repo can be accessed from anywhere and others can also collaborate
    easily using a remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that only the changes that need to be publicly shared get shared.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone: Cloning means making a copy of a repo. Can be used to make a copy
    of local as well as remote repo on local computer.
    Branch: Branching implies creating a seperate independent bracnh. Can
    be used to test and implement experimental features. can be made on 
    remote(GitHub) as well as local repo.
    Fork: Forking is making a clone of a remote repo(GitHub) on the remote 
    repo(GitHub). Forking makes it easy to make changes to an existing 
    project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    One can work remotely without internet and acts as backup in case the 
    remote copy gets corrupted for some reason.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Manually using different folders to save different
    versions. It would be difficult to work together.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When making a pull request or when testing/adding
    a new feature or fixing a bug.
    Changing master branches is easy but master branch
    needs to be stable.
